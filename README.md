# On-Device Personalization Federated Compute Server

The Federated Compute (FC) Server is part of Federated Learning offered by [On-Device Personalization](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/protections/on-device-personalization).

## Overview - A Round of Training Flow
To better understand the server, it is helpful to first describe the flow of a single round of training. Training consists of data flows between the ODP Federated Compute Client (FC Client) that is a core module in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).  Because it is a core module of Android, the interaction in these flows that occur on the FC Client are on device.  The Aggregator is a component built within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) available on a public cloud in its current design.

Training consists of the following steps:
![image](docs/high-level-overview.png)

0. The Federated Compute client on the device downloads a public encryption key from key services.
1. The Federated Compute client checks in with the server and gets a training task.
2. The Federated Compute client downloads training plan, plus the last version of The model, version N.
3. The Federated Compute client trains with the local data and the plan.
4. The Federated Compute client encrypts this deviceâ€™s contributions with the public key obtained in Step 0 and uploads it to the Federated Compute server.
5. The Federated Compute client notifies the Federated Compute server that its training has completed.
6. The Federated Compute server waits until enough clients have submitted their contributions.
7. A round of aggregation is triggered.
8. Encrypted contributions are loaded into a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) by the Aggregator. 
9. The Aggregator attests itself, following NIST's [RFC 9334 Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) Architecture](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9334), to the coordinators. Upon success attestation, the key services grant it the decryption keys. These keys may be split across multiple key providers in a [shamir secret sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing) scheme.
10. The Aggregator does cross-device aggregation, clips and noises per appropriate Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms, and outputs the noised results.
11. The Aggregator triggers the Model Updater.
12. The Model Updater loads the aggregated contribution and applies it to model version N to create model version N + 1. The new model is pushed to the model storage.


This Federated Compute service would be deployed on cloud service(s) which support TEEs and needed security features. As we evaluate cloud providers and underlying technologies, we have focused on a Google Cloud implementation using [Confidential Space](https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/confidential-space).

## Important: This is a preview release
This is a preview version of the On-Device Personalization Federated Compute Server and should be used for testing and evaluation purposes. As such, there are not yet any guarantees about forward/backward source compatibility. It is currently not recommended for use in production settings.



### My work


For shuffler/terraform/gcp/environments/dev2/dev.auto.tfvars
- I created container artifact registry to store docker containers and modify tfvars to point to them like
```shell
    aggregator_image      = "europe-central2-docker.pkg.dev/optimum-shore-442907-k6/odp-fed-compute/aggregator_image:latest"
    model_updater_image   = "europe-central2-docker.pkg.dev/optimum-shore-442907-k6/odp-fed-compute/model_updater_image:latest"
    task_management_image = "europe-central2-docker.pkg.dev/optimum-shore-442907-k6/odp-fed-compute/task_management_image:latest"
```

- Started to create key service with commands

##### Step 1: Enable KMS API
Enable the Google Cloud KMS API in your project:

```shell
    gcloud services enable cloudkms.googleapis.com
```

##### Step 2: Create a Key Ring and Crypto Key
Create a key ring in the region where your infrastructure is located

```shell
gcloud kms keyrings create demo-key-ring --location europe-central2
```

Create a crypto key within the key ring:

```shell
gcloud kms keys create demo-crypto-key \
    --location europe-central2 \
    --keyring demo-key-ring \
    --purpose encryption
```

- Create service accounts
#### 1. Create Service Account A
```shell
gcloud iam service-accounts create shuffler-service-account-a \
    --description="Service account for shuffler operations (A)" \
    --display-name="Shuffler Service Account A"
```
#### 2. Create Service Account B
```shell
gcloud iam service-accounts create shuffler-service-account-b \
    --description="Service account for shuffler operations (B)" \
    --display-name="Shuffler Service Account B"
```

##### Grant roles to the Service Accounts
```shell
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding optimum-shore-442907-k6 \
        --member="serviceAccount:shuffler-service-account-a@optimum-shore-442907-k6.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
        --role="roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter"

    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding optimum-shore-442907-k6 \
        --member="serviceAccount:shuffler-service-account-b@optimum-shore-442907-k6.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
        --role="roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter"
```

#### Deploy cloud function for encrypt/decrypt
```shell
gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com --project=optimum-shore-442907-k6
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com --project=optimum-shore-442907-k6
gcloud functions deploy encrypt_decrypt_function \
    --runtime python310 \
    --trigger-http \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --entry-point encrypt_data \
    --region europe-central2 \
    --source .
gcloud functions describe encrypt_decrypt_function --region europe-central2
```

#### Create operator service accounts
```shell
gcloud iam service-accounts create ca-opallowedusr \
    --description="Service account for Operator A" \
    --display-name="Operator A" \
    --project=optimum-shore-442907-k6
gcloud iam service-accounts create cb-opallowedusr \
    --description="Service account for Operator B" \
    --display-name="Operator B" \
    --project=optimum-shore-442907-k6

```

#### Create Workload Identity Pools
```shell
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create opwip-a \
    --project=optimum-shore-442907-k6 \
    --location="global" \
    --description="Workload Identity Pool for Operator A" \
    --display-name="Operator A WIP"
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create opwip-b \
    --project=optimum-shore-442907-k6 \
